This is where art generation happens.
This should be a convenient place to generate SVGs to be used in ../public/assets.

You can use any of the HTML files here just by opening them in your browser.
From there, you can open the JS console to experiment with them.
Check out [svgpocketguide](https://svgpocketguide.com/) to learn SVG.
Ask in the Discord if anything is confusing to you.



Sorry if the name is weird, this is the best I could come up with.
