# gdg-map

This is the repository for all the code in this project.
If you know how to use git, DM me your GitHub username and I will add you as contributer.

If you don't know how to use git, you can look around at the code here and see what you still need to learn.
There's going to be a workshop where you can learn the basics.

A lot about this project is undecided, even the name.
For discussion, go to the Discord.

**atelier** is where you can learn a bit on how to make SVGs.
**public** is where all the files that are part of the website live.
